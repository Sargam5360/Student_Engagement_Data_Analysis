# Student_Engagement_Data_Analysis

In this project, I apply the Data Analysis Process on the Udacity Student Database.

## 1. Data Acquision and Cleaning

   I acquire the student data from three .csv files and perform data_type conversion (fixation) , 
   removal of ambiguity from column_names.
   I find a difference in length of records in the enrollment and engagement table. I investigate the data points causing the
   ambiguity and resolve it. 
## 2. Posing Question

   How do numbers in the daily engagement table differ for students who pass the first project?
   
## 3. Data Analysis and Exploration

   I get the student data from the first week, explore the student engagement, find out the lessons completed in the first week.
   I find out the number of students passing the entire course and those non passing and then compare them. 
## 4. Drawing Conclusions

   I found out that those students who had higher (daily) engagements in the classrooms and those who finished their first project 
   in the first week had higher chances of completing the course.
## 5. Visualizing the Results

   I made use of numpy to draw the statistical conclusions and represented them using Histograms.
